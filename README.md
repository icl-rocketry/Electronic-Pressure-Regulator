# Electronic-Pressure-Regulator
Sizing, Modelling and Operation of an Electronically Controlled Pressure Regulator.

The Regulator is based on a Commerical Off-The-Shelf (COTS) high pressure ball valve with a custom servo actuator added to precisely control the opening angle. The servo is driven by a modified ICLR Actuator board running a PID closed loop control algorithm. A pressure transducer attached to the propellant tank downstream of the regulator is used as an input to the controller, with the goal to maintain a particular set pressure as flow rate out of the tank varies. The valve design as well as simulation results are shown below:
